    I don't have much hobbies, I'm little lazy person.<meta charset="utf-8"> &#128556;. But the main part in my life is that I'm very concious about my health. So I go to gym regularly. Working out is my favourite thing to do. Doesn't matter how busy I am, how tired I am but I never skip my workout. I'm good in sports and I've won 5 medals in powerlifting, 2 in taekwondo.

               We're 6 members. My grandma, parents and siblings. My brother and sister both are in ottawa and I'm here in India waiting for my visa. I miss them alot but I know when we meet nothing would change, we'll start fighting as every siblings on this planet does <meta charset="utf-8"> &#128514;. Me and my brother's bonding is very strong though. We always stood for each other even after knowing if we were wrong.
